- When in root mode(`sudo -s`), the prompt(`»`) changes from green to yellow.

## Installation

- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Macr0phag3/my-iterm-zsh/master/macr0phag3.zsh-theme`
- Change the theme variable name to `ZSH_THEME="macr0phag3"` in `~/.zshrc`
- Reload ZSH with `source ~/.zshrc`

## Colors
1. Open Preferences pane on the Profiles tab in iTerm
2. Switch to the Colors tab and import the honukai.itermcolors (drop-down in the lower right corner)
